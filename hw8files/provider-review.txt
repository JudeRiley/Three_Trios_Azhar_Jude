The provider's code was well-structured and functional.  They did a good job on ensuring
modularity a clarity with each of the classes.  The interfaces were mostly good however,
there were some weaknesses that made integration challenging.  The GUI components are tightly
coupled with the model, relying directly on the ReadOnlyThreeTrios interface and its methods.
The tight coupling makes the GUI less adaptable to different implementations of the model.

While we were adapting the code, connecting the provider's view and the existing game logic
was also a challenge.  An adapter had to be made to translate the existing model into the
ReadOnlyThreeTrios interface required by the provider's views.  The controller also needed
updates to handle GUI events to translate into model actions.  This was all just pretty
complicated to handle.

To improve the adaptability and usability, the provider's code could benefit from further
decoupling the GUI from the model.  Maybe having something that handles the interactions
between the two would make the GUI more reusable and independent.  Also abstracting
event-handling logic into separate classes could allow for more flexibility.

The provider's code was overall good, just a little bit of changes could possibly make it
perfect.
